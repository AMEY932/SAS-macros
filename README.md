# SAS macros for statistics and graphics

This is a github repository for my entire collection of SAS macros.  These were developed over many years
in conjunction with my books, [*The SAS System for Statistical Graphics*](http://www.datavis.ca/books/sssg/)
and [*Visualizing Categorical Data*](http://www.datavis.ca/books/vcd/), as well as various courses I have
taught, http://www.datavis.ca/courses/index.php.

You can more easily browse my macros by category and view documentation and examples at http://datavis.ca/sasmac/

Some of these in this repository were written by others. I simply collected them here, in a single directory, for use
as a `SASAUTOS` variable in my `autoexec.sas` file so I could test and use them.

Please note that:

* These macros used available SAS facilities at the time of development, mainly base SAS, `SAS/IML`,
`PROC G*` graphics and the Annotate facility.  Some of my graphical methods have been incorporated into
new developments in SAS procedures and ODS graphics.

* I no longer actively support or maintain this macro collection.
