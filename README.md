# SAS-macros

This is a github repository for my entire collection of SAS macros.  These were developed over many years
in conjunction with my books, [*The SAS System for Statistical Graphics*](http://www.datavis.ca/books/sssg/)
and [*Visualizing Categorical Data*](http://www.datavis.ca/books/vcd/), as well as various courses I have
taught, http://www.datavis.ca/courses/index.php.
