=head1 Description

The INFLGLIM macro produces various influence plots for a generalized
linear model fit by PROC GENMOD.  Each of these is a bubble plot of one
diagnostic measure (specified by the C<GY=> parameter) against another
(C<GX=>), with the bubble size proportional to a measure of influence
(usually, C<BUBBLE=COOKD>).  One plot is produced for each combination
of the C<GY=> and C<GX=> variables.

=head1 Usage

The macro normally takes an input data set of raw data and fits the
GLM specified by the RESP=, and C<MODEL=> parameters, using an error
distribution given by the C<DIST=> parameter.  It fits the model,
obtains the OBSTATS and PARMEST data sets, and uses these to compute
some additional influence diagnostics (HAT, COOKD, DIFCHI, DIFDEV,
SERES), any of which may be used as the C<GY=> and C<GX=> variables.

Alternatively, if you have fit a model with PROC GENMOD and saved
the OBSTATS and PARMEST data sets, you may specify these with the
C<OBSTATS=> and C<PARMEST=> parameters.  The same additional diagnostics
are calculated and plotted.

The INFLGLIM macro is called with keyword parameters.
The arguments may be listed within parentheses in any order, separated
by commas. For example: 

  %inflglim(data=berkeley,
     class=dept gender admit,
     resp=freq, model=dept|gender dept|admit,
     dist=poisson,
     id=cell,
     gx=hat, gy=streschi);


=head2 Parameters

=over 4

=item DATA=

Name of input (raw data) data set [Default: C<DATA=_LAST_>]

=item RESP=

The name of response variable.  For a loglin model, this
is usually the frequency or cell count variable when the
data are in grouped form (specify C<DIST=POISSON> in this
case).

=item MODEL=

Gives the model specification.  You may use the '|' and
'@' symbols to specify the model.

=item CLASS=

Specified the ames of any class variables used in the model.

=item DIST=

The name of the PROC GENMOD error distribution.  If you
don't specify the error distribution, PROC GENMOD uses
C<DIST=NORMAL.>

=item LINK=

The name of the link function.  The default is the canonical
link function for the error distribution.

=item MOPT=

Other options on the MODEL statement (e.g., C<MOPT=NOINT>
to fit a model without an intercept.

=item FREQ=

The name of a frequency variable when the data are in
grouped form.

=item WEIGHT=

The name of an bservation weight (SCWGT) variable, used, for
example to specify structural zeros in a loglin model.

=item ID=

Gives the name of a character observation ID variable
which is used to label influential observations in the
plots. Usually you will want to construct a character
variable which combines the C<CLASS=> variables into a
compact cell identifier.

=item GY=

The names of variables in the OBSTATS data set used as
ordinates for in the plot(s). [Default: C<GY=DIFCHI> STRESCHI]

=item GX=

Abscissa(s) for plot, usually  PRED or HAT [Default: C<GX=HAT>]

=item OUT=

Name of output data set, containing the observation
statistics [Default: C<OUT=COOKD>]

=item OBSTATS=

Specifies the name of the OBSTATS data set (containing
residuala and other observation statistics) for a model 
already fitted

=item PARMEST=

Specifies the name of the PARMEST data set (containing
parameter estimates) for a model  already fitted

=item BUBBLE=

Gives the name of the variable to which the bubble size is
proportional [Default: C<BUBBLE=COOKD>]

=item LABEL=

Determines which observations, if any, are labeled in the
plots.  If C<LABEL=NONE>, no observations are labeled; if
C<LABEL=ALL>, all are labeled; if C<LABEL=INFL>, only possibly
influential points are labeled, as determined by the
C<INFL=> parameter. [Default: C<LABEL=INFL>]

=item INFL=

Specifies the criterion used to determine which observations
are influential (when used with C<LABEL=INFL>).
[Default: INFL=%STR(DIFCHI > 4 OR HAT > &HCRIT OR &BUBBLE > 1)]

=item LSIZE=

Observation label size. [Default: C<LSIZE=1.5>]. The height of
other text (e.g., axis labels) is controlled by the C<HTEXT=>
goption.

=item LCOLOR=

Observation label color [Default: C<LCOLOR=BLACK>]

=item LPOS=

Observation label position [Default: C<LPOS=5>]

=item BSIZE=

Bubble size scale factor [Default: C<BSIZE=10>]

=item BSCALE=

Specifies whether the bubble size is proportional to AREA 
or RADIUS [Default: C<BSCALE=AREA>]

=item BCOLOR=

The color of the bubble symbol [Default: C<BCOLOR=RED>]

=item REFCOL=

Color of reference lines [Default: C<REFCOL=BLACK>].  Reference
lines are drawn at nominally 'large' values for HAT values,
standardized residuals, and change in chi square values.

=item REFLIN=

Line style for reference lines. Use C<REFLIN=0> to suppress
these reference lines[Default: C<REFLIN=33>]

=item NAME=

Name of the graph in the graphic catalog [Default:
C<NAME=INFLGLIM>]

=item GOUT=

Name of the graphics catalog
