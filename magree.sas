                                  V1.0
                                      

  DISCLAIMER:
    THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY SAS INSTITUTE INC. AS A SERVICE TO
    ITS USERS.  IT IS PROVIDED "AS IS".  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES,
    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THE MATERIALS OR CODE
    CONTAINED HEREIN.

  PURPOSE:
    Compute estimates and tests of agreement among multiple raters when
    responses (ratings) are on a nominal or ordinal scale. For a nominal
    or ordinal response, kappa statistics can be computed. For a
    numerically-coded, ordinal response, Kendall's coefficient of
    concordance is computed. 

  REQUIRES:
    Release 6.11 TS020 or later of Base SAS and SAS/STAT Software are
    required. %MAGREE can also be run under Release 6.09 TS450 or later on
    MVS, VMS, or CMS. 

  USAGE:
    You must first define the %MAGREE macro so that it is available for
    use. Simply submit this file to the SAS System to define the macro.
    You may then invoke the macro. The EXAMPLE section below illustrates
    how this is done. 

    The input (DATA=) data set should contain one observation per rating
    (i.e. an observation contains one rating on one subject by one rater)
    with variables containing subject and rater identifiers and a variable
    containing the rating (response). The same set of rater values must be
    used for each subject, even if subjects are rated by different raters
    (which is only valid for kappa statistics). 

    The following parameters are required:

        items=        Specifies the variable containing subject (item)
                      identifiers.  This variable may be numeric or 
                      character.

        raters=       Specifies the variable containing rater
                      identifiers.  This variable may be numeric or 
                      character.  The same rater values must be used
                      for all subjects even if subjects are rated by 
                      different raters.  Note that Kendall's statistic
                      is only valid when all subjects are rated by the
                      same raters.

        response=     Specifies the variable containing the ratings.
                      This variable may be numeric or character. If it 
                      is character, it is assumed to be nominal and
                      only kappa statistics are computed.  If it is
                      numeric, either or both statistic can be
                      computed, but note that Kendall's statistic is
                      only valid for ordinal responses.

    The following parameter is optional:

        data=         Identifies the input data set to be analyzed.
                      If not specified, the last-created data set is
                      used.
 
        stat=         Specifies which statistic to calculate.  Use
                      stat=kappa to compute kappa statistics.  Use
                      stat=kendall to compute Kendall's coefficient of
                      concordance.  Use stat=both to compute both
                      statistics.  By default, stat=both.

    
  PRINTED OUTPUT:
    Following is selected output from the EXAMPLE presented below. The
    first ten observations corresponding to the first two subjects are
    shown to illustrate the proper form of the input data set.

    If the response variable is numeric, as it is in this example, and
    if it is also ordinal, then both kappa and Kendall's statistics are
    valid.  If this response were only nominal, then Kendall's statistic
    should be ignored or not computed by specifying the stat=kappa
    parameter.  Both the overall kappa statistic and Kendall's
    coefficient of concordance are highly significant indicating stronger
    agreement than can be expected by chance.  The kappa statistics for
    the individual response categories indicate the degree of agreement on
    each category.  In this example, agreement is strongest on category 2.

  DETAILS:
    The methodology implemented by the %MAGREE macro is presented in
    Fleiss (1981) and Kendall (1955). See these references for details. 

    Unlike the AGREE option in PROC FREQ, weighted kappa and confidence
    intervals are not provided by this macro. 

    Note that the RATERS= variable must use the same values to identify
    the raters in all subjects even if different raters are used to rate
    the subjects, which is only valid for the kappa statistic. Both
    statistics require that the number of raters be the same across all
    subjects. 

    Ties are only a concern with Kendall's statistic and are handled by
    the macro. Tests provided for the kappa statistics and Kendall's 
    statistic are asymptotic (large sample) tests.

    Landis and Koch (1977) attempted to indicate the degree of agreement
    that exists when kappa is found to be in various ranges:

         <=0    Poor 
         0-.2   Slight 
        .2-.4   Fair 
        .4-.6   Moderate 
        .6-.8   Substantial 
        .8-1    Almost perfect 

    Values of all statistics and their p-values are available in data sets
    after execution of the macro. The kappa estimates and related
    statistics are in the data set _KAPPAS. Kendall's coefficient and
    related statistic are in the data set _W. 

  LIMITATIONS:
    Limited error checking is done. Be sure that the ITEMS=, RATERS=, and
    RESPONSE= variables are properly spelled and exist in the DATA= data
    set. You can use PROC CONTENTS to verify the variable names in a data
    set. 

    The set of values in the RATERS= variable must be the same for all
    subjects, even if different raters are used for different subjects
    (which is only valid for the kappa statistic). See "MISSING VALUES"
    below. Kendall's statistic requires that the response variable be
    numeric and ordinal. 

  MISSING VALUES:
    An error message is issued if it is determined that each rater does
    not rate each subject exactly once. The macro detects this error under
    any of the following conditions: 

     - Different rater values are found for different subjects
     - Missing values appear in the subject, rater, or response variables
     - A rater does not rate some subject(s) 
     - A subject is not rated by some rater(s)
     - All subjects do not have an equal number of ratings
     - More than one rating of a subject by a rater
 
  SEE ALSO:
    The FREQ procedure in Base SAS software can compute simple and
    weighted kappa statistics for comparing two raters.  Use the AGREE
    option on the TABLES statement.  

    The intraclass correlation coefficient can be used to test rater
    agreement (or reliability) on continuous responses. See the %INTRACC
    macro available at the following web address:
